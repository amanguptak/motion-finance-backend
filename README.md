# Motion Finance - Backend

Welcome to the backend code repository for Motion Finance! This repository contains the server-side code responsible for managing user authentication, financial data, and other backend functionalities for the Motion Finance application.

## About Motion Finance

Motion Finance is a personal finance management application designed to help users track their income, expenses, savings, investments, and budgeting goals. The application provides a user-friendly interface for managing financial transactions, setting budgets, receiving notifications, and generating analytics reports to improve financial health.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- Prisma ORM (Optional)
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication
- RESTful API architecture

## Getting Started

To get started with the Motion Finance backend code, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Set up environment variables:

    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and define the following environment variables:

    ```plaintext
    PORT=3000
    MONGODB_URI=<mongodb-connection-uri>
    JWT_SECRET=<your-jwt-secret>
    ```

    Replace `<mongodb-connection-uri>` with your MongoDB connection URI and `<your-jwt-secret>` with your JWT secret key.

4. Run the server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    The server should now be running on the specified port.
